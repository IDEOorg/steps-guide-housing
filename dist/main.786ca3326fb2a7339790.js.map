It is, however, guaranteed that all subscribers\n   * registered before the `dispatch()` started will be called with the latest\n   * state by the time it exits.\n   *\n   * @param {Function} listener A callback to be invoked on every dispatch.\n   * @returns {Function} A function to remove this change listener.\n   */\n  function subscribe(listener) {\n    if (typeof listener !== 'function') {\n      throw new Error('Expected listener to be a function.');\n    }\n\n    var isSubscribed = true;\n\n    ensureCanMutateNextListeners();\n    nextListeners.push(listener);\n\n    return function unsubscribe() {\n      if (!isSubscribed) {\n        return;\n      }\n\n      isSubscribed = false;\n\n      ensureCanMutateNextListeners();\n      var index = nextListeners.indexOf(listener);\n      nextListeners.splice(index, 1);\n    };\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Dispatches an action.
